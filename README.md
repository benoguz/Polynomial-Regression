polynomial regression model for a single predictor, X, is:

where h is called the degree of the polynomial. For lower degrees, the relationship has a specific name (i.e., h = 2 is called quadratic, h = 3 is called cubic, h = 4 is called quartic, and so on). Although this model allows for a nonlinear relationship between Y and X, polynomial regression is still considered linear regression since it is linear in the regression coefficients β1, β2,..., βh!

# Trend and Seasonality Analysis
> Polynomial regression:

Lineer Regression Assumption:
data = model + noise

noise is a kind of gaussian or normal distribution so we need to check the residual by using the normality test (Shapiro-Wilk) but first let's look at trend.
