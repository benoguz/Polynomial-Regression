Data is generated by using Quasiperiodic function and additive noise 

# *Polynomial Regression*

Polynomial regression model for a single predictor, X, is:

where h is called the degree of the polynomial. For lower degrees, the relationship has a specific name (i.e., h = 2 is called quadratic, h = 3 is called cubic, h = 4 is called quartic, and so on). Although this model allows for a nonlinear relationship between Y and X, polynomial regression is still considered linear regression since it is linear in the regression coefficients β1, β2,..., βh!

# *Trend and Seasonality Analysis*
> ## *Polynomial regression:*

Lineer Regression Assumption:
data = model + noise

Noise is a kind of gaussian or normal distribution so we need to check the residual by using the normality test (Shapiro-Wilk) but first let's look at trend.

The main idea is to extract the different modes of a signal by designing an appropriate wavelet filter bank. This construction leads us to build adaptive wavelets called the empirical wavelet transform.

> ## *Singular Spectrum Analysis*

In time series analysis, singular spectrum analysis (SSA) is a nonparametric spectral estimation method. It combines elements of classical time series analysis, multivariate statistics, multivariate geometry, dynamical systems and signal processing.
